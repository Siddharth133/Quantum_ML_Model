# Quantum_ML_Model
This is the implementation of the project **Underwater Marine Animmal Classification** using Quantum CNN with the help of hybrid models RESNET50,RESNET18 and INCEPTION model.
This project was completely build under the **CODERED Hackathon** which was hosted at BMSIT - 2024.
For this hackathon we have build a dynamic website which helps to increase user interaction. Coming to the model part
we have make use of QCNN (Quantum Convolutional Nueral Network) here what we have been is we have first made 
function for Quantum QUbits generation and circuits formatation then we have use it as a layer to pretrained well
-know model RESNET50 & Inception model. We have tried with different set of QUbits value and different epoch values
then we have achieved accuracy score of 80% with this hybrid model of classical approach and quantum approach.We
have also integrated various other feature to this where we have build a chatbot for user interaction related to 
marine animals. For chatbot we have used gpt2-LLM model and we have created our own dataset for it and then we have trained model on it so it gives all answer related to the marine animals domain.Also furthur we have integrated the database for storing user interaction with chatbot so it can be again feedin to chatbot to learn from it.
Next we have also make use of google maps API keys to get the location about the animals classified.
All details and webdesign is shown in figure.
